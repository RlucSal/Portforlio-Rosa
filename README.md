# Rosa-Portolio

## Description 

### Develop a portfolio that satisties the following  acceptable criteria:
1. When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your 
   work, and how to contact you
2. When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
3. When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
4. When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
5. When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
6. When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

### Motivation 

1. A portfolio is more than just a compilation of projects; it's a narrative of a life's work. It's a place to weave the story of a journey, experiences, and the passions that drive ourselfs. 

2. A portfolio is a digital business card. It demonstrates expertise, skills, and  commitment. It's a window for potential clients, employers, and collaborators to peek into our world and witness your capabilities.

3. In a world where digital presence is vital, a well-crafted portfolio sets us apart. It showcases our dedication to our profession and the time that we invested in our personal brand. It's an opportunity to shine in a crowded digital space.

4. It's a reflection of our growth and development over time. It's not just a showcase of our work; it's a testimony to our progress and a reminder of our potential.

5. A portfolio isn't just about self-promotion; it's about sharing our knowledge, inspiring others, and building meaningful connections.
